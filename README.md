# 🎵 **MusicDiscEffects**

**MusicDiscEffects** is a lightweight Paper/Spigot plugin that gives **custom potion effects** whenever a player is *holding a music disc* in their main-hand or off-hand.

Perfect for SMPs, PvP servers, RPG worlds, or any server where you want music discs to matter.

Each disc grants a **unique, configurable potion effect**, applied instantly and removed cleanly when the disc is no longer held.
